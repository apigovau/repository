January 1970, not counting leap seconds.\n\nIt is valuable for developers as it automatically incorporates daylight savings time and time zones. \n\nThere are several functions in most programming

Each match is awarded a score based on how closely it matches the search criteria. The best results are achieved by entering as much of the name as you know. For more information see [Search tips](http://abn.business.gov.au/Help/SearchTips).\n\nA matching record contains:\n\n-   ABN and status\n-   Matching name, current/historical indicator and match score\n-   State and postcode of the main business location\n\n## ABN list\n\nThe _Search with Filters_ methods return zero or more ABNs.

To ensure existing ABN Lookup web service users are not adversely affected, changes to the structure of the information returned may be implemented through new web service methods\n\nFor example, in July 2005 new legislation was introduced that effected the information recorded about tax concessions. We implemented new methods for searching by ABN and ACN which extended the information returned to include tax concession information where it existed. The schema was updated to reflect these changes without invalidating the information already being returned through existing web service methods. Likewise in September 2007 we implemented a new method which extended the information returned to include superannuation funds information where it exists. Then in May 2012 a new method was released that extended the information returned to include registered business names.\n\nIf you are integrating the web services for the first time or upgrading your existing applications, we recommend that you use the latest web service method (eg: [Search by ABN](Search by ABN), [Search by ASIC number](Search by ASIC number), [Search by Name](Search by Name), [Search with Filters](Search with Filters)) available.\n"], "description": "The ABN Lookup web services allow you to incorporate ABN information and search capabilities into your own applicaitons"}}]}');

One of the specifications relates to the [Digital Capability Locator](http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/digital-capability-locator/) (DCL), a central component to enable dynamic discovery of business'' endpoints.\n\nThe DCL consists of two major components:\n\n1. A way for anyone connected to the internet to find the location of a Digital Capability Publisher for a business, this is the [Discovery API](Discovery&#32;API); and\n2. A database of trusted services providers operating in the framework. Trusted service providers are added to the database after undergoing an assessment of their intention to provide access point services and/or digital capability services as part of the interoperability framework.\n\n\n## Base URL\nDuring testing the API is served from https://uatapi.intechdcl.gov/api/v1.\n\n## API specification\nThe Digital Business Council publishes the [Digital Capability Locator implementation guide](http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/assets/Digital+Capability+Locator+Implementation+Guide+v2.0.1.pdf). This is the official specification with a core set of API''s that supports the main service provider use cases. The implementation guide describes how the core API''s are used.\n\nThere are some inconsistencies in the implementation guide which are documented in the [errata](Errata).\n\n## Participant ID\nAs per the Digital Business Council policy on identifiers, participants are identified by a scheme and a value. The scheme and value are used across the interoperability framework including the DCL API.\n\n## Authentication\nUsage of the DCL API is restricted to approved service providers only. Mutual exchange of TLS certificates governs access to the API. Service providers are encouraged to register with the Digital Capability Locator and store their public server and client certificates in the DCL Service Provider database.\n\nUpon initial registration, service providers will provide the ATO with their certificates which will be added to the service provider database by ATO staff. Once registered, service providers have the ability to update their own certificates through the management API.\n\n**Note**: During the testing period, only test certificates issued by the ATO are recognised by the system. \n\nBelow is a sample request using the CURL commandline tool:\nAssuming that:\n* The private key is stored in a file called key.pem\n* The certificate associated with the private key is stored in cert.pem\n\nExample request:\n```bash\n$ curl -v --key key.pem --cert cert.pem -H accept=application/json -tlsv1.2 \\\nhttps://uatapi.intechdcl.com/api/v1/capabilityPublishers\\?offset\\=0\\&limit\\=50\n```\n\nExample response as JSON:\n```javascript\n{\n    \"metadata\": {\n        \"resultset\": {\n            \"count\": 16,\n            \"offset\": 0,\n            \"limit\": 50\n        }\n    },\n    \"results\": [...]\n}    \n```\n", "# Errata\nThis page describes any discrepancies between the implementation guide and the implemented solution.\n\n* Participant API  \nThe participant identifier is encoded as per the Digital Business Council Policy on Business Identifiers. \n* Section 8.3.2 Delete Participant Capability Address  \nA body is **not** required when deleting a relationship between a Digital Capability Publisher and a participant\n* Section 8.4.1 Update Digital Capability Publisher End-Point  \nThe `domainName` field has been renamed to `URL`. \n* The capability publisher ID and Access Point ID can be determined using the WhoAmI API\n", "# Core Discovery API\nThe Digital Capability Locator implements the [OASIS Business Document Metadata Service Location](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/BDX-Location/v1.0/BDX-Location-v1.0.html) standard.
